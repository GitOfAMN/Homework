### What do the HTTP Status Codes represent?
- The status code in the first line informs us on how the request/response went. It is always a three-digit number that falls within the following ranges/categories:

    - 1xx Informational
    - 2xx Success
    - 3xx Redirection
    - 4xx Client Error
    - 5xx Server Error

- Most HTTP responses will have a status code of 200, which means OK. You also might be familiar with the status code of 404- Not Found.

- The Response Body is what holds the content of the requested resource.

- The Content-Type header helps the browser determine what to do with the data being sent in the body of the HTTP response. For example:
    - text/html: The browser will parse the body as HTML and, depending on how the HTTP request was initiated, usually replace the browser window's content with the newly received HTML.
    - image/png

- Although the HTTP protocol is text-based, the content in the body can be binary, for example, images are typically transferred in binary format.
