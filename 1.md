### What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do?
- Together, HTML, CSS, and JS make up what is called the front end of a web browser; what a user or site visitor sees when visiting a URL.
- HTML = the structure or the bones of a site
- CSS = presentation/appearance of a site (what nakes it pretty)
- JS = the dynamism/action of a site (what bring the site to life)


### What is the difference between backend and frontend?
- Frontend focuses on the visual elements and interactive elements of a website or app.
- Backend is what we use to power our web servers and connect to our databases.
