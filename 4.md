### What is Big O Notation?

- Big O time is the language and metric used to describe the efficiency of algorithms.

- Big O gives us way to talk about the efficiency of algorithms (broadly described as their runtime) and allows us to judge what exactly makes an algorithm faster, slower, and more or less space efficient than a similar algorithm. This means we can make better programming decisions!

### Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta.

- Asymptotic upper bound is given by Big O notation. The algorithm's lower bound is represented by Omega notation. The asymptotic lower bound is given by Omega notation. The bounding of function from above and below is represented by theta notation.

### Linear Time Complexity O(N)

-As the size of the input grows the processing time required by the algorithm will grow at the same pace. N represents the size of the input.

O(N) is somewhat efficient. No matter how big the constant is or how slow the linear increase is, at some point the linear algorithm will have a longer runtime

## EXAMPLES
- Searching an array
- Performing an action on every element in an array.
- Inserting an element alphabetically into an array
- Downloading something (this example overly simplifies this process)
- Searching page by page for a name in a phone book.

If 1 item takes 1 second to process, 100 items take 100 seconds to process or 1.66667 minutes

## Code Example

```
// Creates this array: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
tinyArray = Array.from(Array(10).keys())
// Creates a very large array starting with: [0, 1, 2, 3 ...]
largeArray = Array.from(Array(100000000).keys())

findRandomNumberInArray(tinyArray)
findRandomNumberInArray(largeArray)

function findRandomNumberInArray(arr) {
  const randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (randomNum === arr[i]) return arr[i]
  }
}
```

### Quadratic Time Complexity O(N^2)

- For each time the input grows the processing time required by the algorithm will grow exponentially. N represents the size of the input. O(N^2) is inefficient and should be avoided if possible.

## EXAMPLES

- Many sorting algorithms have quadratic complexity (quicksort, bubble sort, insertion sort, etc.)
- Performing an action on every item in a 2D array
- Searching in a 2D array
- Nested loops.

If 1 item takes 1 second to process, 100 times take 10,000 seconds to process or 166.6667 minutes or 2.777... hours

## Code Example

```
const fakeTwoDimensionArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

logArray(fakeTwoDimensionArray)

function logArray(arr) {
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    console.log(arr[i])
    for(let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++){
      console.log("i: ", arr[i], "j: ", arr[j])
    }
  }
}
```
