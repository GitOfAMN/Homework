### What is Big O Notation?

- Big O time is the language and metric used to describe the efficiency of algorithms.

- Big O gives us way to talk about the efficiency of algorithms (broadly described as their runtime) and allows us to judge what exactly makes an algorithm faster, slower, and more or less space efficient than a similar algorithm. This means we can make better programming decisions!

### Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta.

- Asymptotic upper bound is given by Big O notation. The algorithm's lower bound is represented by Omega notation. The asymptotic lower bound is given by Omega notation. The bounding of function from above and below is represented by theta notation.
